  The projects below are some interesting computer-science and engineering ideas that I implemented.
  
1. FILTER ANALYSIS SOFTWARE
- This is a contribution code to a radio filter system.
- It receievs frequency of sound signals as an input.
- It uses the algorithm and checks if the frequency of the noise is allowed.
- If the noise is allowed, it switches the radio's filter to an appropriate filter to check the sound.
-The available filters are low-pass, band-pass and high-pass filters.


2.  SPRING MASS DUMPING PROTOTYPE
- This is also a contribution to a mechanical car dumping system.
- The input data is fed into the program.
- The program calculates the stiffness, damping ratio and other mechanical quantities of the car.
- The algorithm then writes these details into a file which is sent to the user.
- The output generated is then used to detect if the car needs servicing and to which extent it should be serviced.

3.  TRAFFIC LIGHT INTERSECTION/ CAR JUNCTIOON SIMULATION.
- This algorothm is solely based on OOP.
- The algorithm genearetes a simulation of a 4-way junction.
- It checks and signals green and red respectively to signal "move" or "stop".
- It updates the waitijg times based on the traffic situation on a particlar highway.
